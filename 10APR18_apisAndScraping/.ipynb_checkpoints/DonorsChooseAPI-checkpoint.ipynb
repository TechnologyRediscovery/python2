My students are  diverse in culture, abilities and needs and I can’t wait to watch them all grow over the next year.  My goal as a teacher is to make sure that each student not only feels successful but IS successful. Throughout the year, my students will learn to love themselves, build positive relationships with others and foster a love for learning that will be carried with them throughout their educational career.  \\n\\nTo quote Martin Luther King Jr.-“Intelligence plus character-this is the goal for true education.”  I too believe this to be true and I will take my high energy kinders and lead them to become confident, self-regulating, curiosity seeking individuals who will grow to make a positive impact on our world.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kindergarten is such an important year in a child’s life.  It is here that they begin the process of becoming life-long learners.  However, in order to become a life-long learner students need to feel successful in the classroom as well as gain a love for learning.  Success will happen by placing students in an environment that nurtures both their academic development as well as their social emotional development. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo quote Aristotle-&#034;Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all&#034;.  Therefore, with the grant money, I would like to purchase materials to help teach Mindful Awareness and empathy.  I began teaching mindful awareness in my classroom last school year, and after a very short amount of time, I was witness to its success.  It gives students strategies for self-regulating which, ultimately allows them calm their body and mind, choose mindful behavior over unmindful behavior and allows them to be reflective rather than reactive.  I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting, researching and reading up on ways to better support my students as a whole.  In the end, I’ve realized that idea is quite simple.  When you go back and look at Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs we know that our students need to be satisfied on a Social Emotional level before they are ready to learn.  However, in school, we spend the majority of the time focusing on academics and have little time to explicitly help foster social/emotional development.

When our pencils break, it can be a challenge not having a pencil sharpener that works.  In our classroom the wall sharpener does not work and is hard for second graders to use when it is in service. Also we are constantly needing to label things in our classroom, such as supplies, notebooks, books, etc.  Labels can be so expensive!  So that is why we have added labels to this need of supplies!\\n \\n\\nAn electronic sharpener is such a help in a second grade classroom!

Many of them come from troubled homes and have trouble affording basic school supplies. While many arise from difficult settings, I have found that my students show great resilience and potential to compete academically with students from more privileged districts. Students at my school are often subjected to negative influences from the area and struggle to find themselves in life. I believe that these are the students who most need a special touch to prevent them from falling in with bad crowds and demonstrate their true capabilities as learners. My school has a reputation associated with the inner city but for those who truly know, they&#039;re good kids in bad situations.\\r\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an attempt to flip my classroom, I have begun using Schoology, an online site where teachers have the ability to post a variety of materials which students can access including but not limited to assignments, notes, videos, interactive simulations and articles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause many students do not have access to a computer outside of school, these iPads will be used for students who are unable to access those materials otherwise.\\r\\nIn addition to Schoology, my students will be using Nearpod, an online presentation service that allows teachers to present material at either a fixed or student lead pace. Nearpod is very helpful to students who would have trouble viewing the material on a projector screen or the whiteboard. The students will also use Quizlet, an online flash card service where teachers create flashcards and students use them to study in several different formats. The goal with each of these online services is to maximize student participation by providing a diverse presentation of the abstract subject of chemistry and therefore, expand their level of comprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy students come to school each day facing adversity that most of us do not experience in our lives. Because of this, they are at a disadvantage to their national peers. School is a welcoming place where they can express themselves in an environment free of judgment, something many of my students lack at home.

I have nervously witnessed students stepping on backpacks. We lack a coat closet for the students, so we ask they hang their backpacks off their chairs. Seldom do their backpacks stay there. At any time during the day you see backpacks on the floor. This can become a safety issue. A backpack cart  can help our class stay organized. \\r\\nThe stem and Lego kit is essential for hands-on learning. Kindergarteners need to manipulate objects to make abstract concepts understandable.  The iPad is a small but significant addition to the limited amount of computers we have in the class. It is vital because we put students on the computers several times a week for our language arts program. We want  them exposed often to the  common core standards. Also, we are doing math.

As Donalyn Miller wrote in The Book Whisperer, “This is how I show my students that I love them - by putting books in their hands, by noticing what they are about, and finding books that tell them, ‘I know. I know. I know how it is. I know who you are, and even though we may never speak of it, read this book, and know that I understand you.’” By allowing my students to share  their stories in my classroom  and about the things they value outside of school, I am demonstrating that every aspect of who they are is important. \\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the use of this book, I hope to empower my students to tell their own stories, and to share their own diverse experiences.  I want to show my students that I love and value their stories by centering my instruction on their lives, their realities and their experiences, and using their stories to guide our learning.\\r\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;', 'percentFunded': '0', 'numDonors': '0', 'costToComplete': '647.34', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '50', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': '', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': '', 'donorSalutation': '', 'type': '', 'matchImpactMultiple': '', 'multipleForDisplay': '', 'logoURL': '', 'faqURL': '', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': ''}, 'totalPrice': '647.34', 'freeShipping': 'true', 'teacherId': '5519516', 'teacherName': 'Mrs. Herdman', 'gradeLevel': {'id': '3', 'name': 'Grades 6-8'}, 'povertyLevel': 'Data Unavailable', 'povertyType': {'label': 'UNKNOWN', 'name': 'Data unavailable', 'range': 'Data unavailable', 'showPovertyLevel': 'false'}, 'teacherTypes': [], 'schoolTypes': [], 'schoolName': 'Wilson Elementary School PreK - 8', 'schoolUrl': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/school/wilson-elementary-school-prek-8/122238/', 'city': 'Youngstown', 'zip': '44502-2305', 'state': 'OH', 'stateFullName': 'Ohio', 'latitude': '41.071750006335700', 'longitude': '-80.642850000035200', 'zone': {'id': '213', 'name': 'Ohio'}, 'subject': {'id': '10', 'name': 'Literacy', 'groupId': '6'}, 'additionalSubjects': [{'id': '3', 'name': 'Literature &amp; Writing', 'groupId': '6'}], 'resource': {'id': '9', 'name': 'Books'}, 'expirationDate': '2018-11-10', 'fundingStatus': 'needs funding'}, {'id': '3661767', 'proposalURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/project/bringing-engineering-aeronautics-to-th/3661767/?utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=bodylink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'fundURL': 'https://secure.donorschoose.org/donors/givingCart.html?proposalid=3661767&donationAmount=45&utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=fundlink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'imageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/small/u5678571_sm.jpg?timestamp=1538280373360', 'retinaImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/retina/u5678571_retina.jpg?timestamp=1538280373360', 'thumbImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/thumbnail/u5678571_thmb.jpg?timestamp=1538280373360', 'title': 'Bringing Engineering &amp; Aeronautics to the Inner City', 'shortDescription': 'I teach a group of intellectually able but resource deprived, inner city students who are eager to learn!

Our class consists of 30 students most of them receives resource services, and speech therapy along with occupational therapy.  Some of my students are learning to read, write, and count while some of their classmates  are learning to imitate sounds or hold a pencil. A few of my students are in pampers. Our group loves to play outside, learn new games and participate in special Olympics(Bowling, soccer, basketball etc.\\r\\nAs my students make gains in my classroom, they begin to try small chunks of the day with their typically developing peers. The work we do in this classroom is about building skills to get included. We celebrate little wins together each day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials and supplies that I am requesting for my students already have a &#034;home&#034; In other words I know exactly where everything will go. We just need your help in getting everything through our door! The Chromebook will allow a child to use up to to date technology. The color printer will allow the students to print enrichment and quality colorful projects. The headphones with mic will enhance the volume to learning. The Samsung Galaxy will assist my non-verbal students. The Lenovo all in one will bring the exceptional needed technology to our classroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe donations to this project will help to improve my students&#039; understanding of an competency, while using essential technology.

Bluegills just happen to be our official state fish and are hardy enough to grow indoors and are an excellent delicious source of protein. Students will engineer a floating system for growing herbs on top just as our Aztec and Mesopotamian ancestors did centuries ago. Students will also use STEM practices such as collecting and monitoring water quality data with the 3 in 1 water test strips, while learning about horticulture and aquaculture. And last, but not least, the most exciting part of our project will be to showcase the success of our program, along with learning from any failures, at events such as our neighborhood farmers&#039; markets.', 'percentFunded': '0', 'numDonors': '0', 'costToComplete': '585.76', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '120', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': 'SAMSUNG19', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': 'Samsung', 'donorSalutation': 'Samsung', 'type': 'AUTO_DONATION_MATCH', 'matchImpactMultiple': 1.5, 'multipleForDisplay': '1.5X', 'logoURL': 'https://cdn.donorschoose.net/images/logos/samsung_solvefortomorrow_250.png', 'faqURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/donors/matching_grant_popup.html?matchingKey=SAMSUNG19', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': '<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.donorschoose.net/images/logos/samsung_solvefortomorrow_250.png\"></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Donations to this project are now being matched, thanks to support from Samsung.

As our class sizes continue to grow, I am always looking for different ways to keep students motivated and engaged. They like to move, they love to express creativity, and they respond to positive attention and various privileges. \\nMany of them are being raised in single parent households and receive a free lunch based on their socioeconomic status. These things may prevent them from getting ahead early in their lives and they may not be provided with the life experiences many of us see as &#034;typical.&#034; From the minute they walk in the door of my classroom, I focus on their potential and growth while they are with me.

A large percent of my high school students are classified as English Learners and require extra attention. In addition, there are a large number of at risk students who require intervention by teachers, counselors, and administrators to help them remain on track. Many of them come from troubled homes and have trouble affording basic school supplies. While many arise from difficult settings, I have found that my students show great resilience and potential to compete academically with students from more privileged districts. Students at my school are often subjected to negative influences from the area and struggle to find themselves in life.

I absolutely love the school where I am at!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy students love the opportunity to learn in hands-on ways, experiencing their learning. They explore, investigate, and apply their understanding of complex concepts. As a teacher, I constantly challenge myself to develop meaningful and innovative learning opportunities that allow them to experience learning.\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a passionate reader I instantly fell in love with my Kindle. Thousands of books available at the click of my finger! Even more than that, Kindle devices allow readers to interact with the text in meaningful ways. As a teacher I am constantly reviewing strategies to help students figure out the meanings of words from context. The Kindle allows students to simply hover over the word and view the definition. Even more, students can click on characters and find summaries to help them review, they can highlight text, and record notes. Currently my students&#039; books are filled with Post-It notes outlining their thinking. Unfortunately, they are difficult to reference and share. Using the Kindle devices their notes are accessible and all of their thinking is warehoused in one location.\\r\\n\\r\\n Kindle tablets can transform my reading instruction, engaging all students.   In my classroom I use a teaching strategy called Readers Workshop. As part of the Readers Workshop, I teach about a focused reading strategy, and then students go and apply it in their independent texts, of a similar genre. The difficulty with this model is we need a massive amount of texts. Because of the wonderful local libraries and their e-readers collections, my problems will be solved.

This positive attitude is made possible by creating a safe and organized environment for every child and providing them with the resources to explore, problem-solve, and apply the knowledge they have acquired throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning math is so much more engaging through collaboration with friends in a fun and new environment. With the addition of such resources like Math Activity Centers, Power Pen Math Quiz Cards, and the Giant Magnetic Math Skills Chart, students will not only be learning but having fun throughout the process. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudents will have the opportunity to collaborate on math concepts with friends at their brand new Rainbow Group Table Center with matching chairs. What better way to solidify critical thinking and problem-solving skills than with friends. With the addition of the group table and chairs, along with the new resources, students will be excited about math!', 'percentFunded': '0', 'numDonors': '0', 'costToComplete': '994.59', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '28', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': '', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': '', 'donorSalutation': '', 'type': '', 'matchImpactMultiple': '', 'multipleForDisplay': '', 'logoURL': '', 'faqURL': '', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': ''}, 'totalPrice': '994.59', 'freeShipping': 'true', 'teacherId': '4031565', 'teacherName': 'Mrs. Black', 'gradeLevel': {'id': '1', 'name': 'Grades PreK-2'}, 'povertyLevel': '', 'povertyType': {'label': 'LOW', 'name': '', 'range': '0%-30%', 'showPovertyLevel': 'false'}, 'teacherTypes': [], 'schoolTypes': [], 'schoolName': 'Arnold Elementary School', 'schoolUrl': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/school/arnold-elementary-school/25026/', 'city': 'Torrance', 'zip': '90505-2246', 'state': 'CA', 'stateFullName': 'California', 'latitude': '33.822281000000000', 'longitude': '-118.356694000000000', 'zone': {'id': '411', 'name': 'California (South)'}, 'subject': {'id': '19', 'name': 'Other', 'groupId': '5'}, 'additionalSubjects': [{'id': '8', 'name': 'Mathematics', 'groupId': '4'}], 'resource': {'id': '13', 'name': 'Reading Nooks, Desks &amp; Storage'}, 'expirationDate': '2019-01-30', 'fundingStatus': 'needs funding'}, {'id': '3668913', 'proposalURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/project/ipad-minis-for-body-awareness/3668913/?utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=bodylink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'fundURL': 'https://secure.donorschoose.org/donors/givingCart.html?proposalid=3668913&donationAmount=45&utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=fundlink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'imageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/small/u3306111_sm.jpg?timestamp=1536361996614', 'retinaImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/retina/u3306111_retina.jpg?timestamp=1536361996614', 'thumbImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/thumbnail/u3306111_thmb.jpg?timestamp=1536361996614', 'title': 'iPad Minis for Body Awareness!', 'shortDescription': 'My students are pre-k to second graders and love to move.

It makes me so happy to know that most young kids are enthusiastic about exercise. I want to encourage this love for movement by providing as many successful experiences for them as possible in the Physical Education classes that I teach. I hope that their experiences will instill a desire for lifetime fitness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students could really benefit from having some technology available in our Physical Education classes, like two iPad minis. We have a limited supply of iPads in our school and they are all used in the academic classrooms.

I would like to have a local university athletic team record themselves doing certain exercises or skills so that I can create QR codes, have the students scan the code, and the college athlete will give my students a video demonstration and a motivational message. I am hoping this partnership will inspire my young students to do their best in my class, but also to show them examples of people out in the world who are doing amazing things and reaching high goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kids also want to video themselves to see what they look like when they do a skill. This is a great opportunity for the students to get some real world experience with technology, be creative and analyze their own work. Taking ownership of their work and being interactive can be inspirational and lead to more success in the classroom. Having access to iPads in my Physical Education classes would be very beneficial when it comes to showing my students examples of what other kids are doing to get exercise, stay healthy, and challenge themselves.

Reflecting on my prior year, I know and research purports that if children are not rigorously engaged in their learning and on a level that meets their individual learning needs they will often  resort to poor behavior which then aides in their perpetual low academic performance. Therefore MY STUDENTS MUST HAVE learning centers that are interesting and hands on! Centers that address their unique learning styles. Centers that will further the whole child and enhance academic development. The supplies and materials I have chosen will offer my students a lot of fun, engaging, confident building approaches connecting them to their learning in a meaningful way.

Along the way, students encourage each other while riding, get necessary movement, and work towards reaching our class goal. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce we reach our destination, we celebrate!

My students will most likely never leave Ohio, let alone the United States. The best way for them to travel and learn about other cultures is through books. After traveling to a number of third world countries in 2013 I like to use my experiences to share the world with my students. \\r\\nThis year we will be reading our way &#034;Around the World in 180 Days.&#034; My students want to learn about the people they do not see sitting in the desk next to them, but do see on television.

Students need diverse books! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reading a great professional development book on transforming classroom learning into dynamic learning experiences, I&#039;ve come up with a plan to help enrich our reading experience for the school year. Our theme will be Around the World in 180 Days. Each quarter will have a travel destination theme. Quarter one will be a fantasy land, specifically the planets in A Wrinkle in Time, in order to focus on fiction and narrative writing. Quarter two will be about traveling to Europe during World War II and the life of Anne Frank. Quarter three we will travel through characters who immigrant to other countries, like those from the novel Refugee. Finally, in quarter four we will travel to Africa as Salva walks from Sudan to Kenya in A Long Walk to Water. \\r\\nOur students will be exposed to a number of cultures and characters that they would not normally have an opportunity to experience. Each quarter will begin with a whole class novel in order for us to lay foundational skills. Then we will move into small group reading clubs. This will allow us to give more specialized instruction through fiction novels and nonfiction supplemental materials. The final three weeks of the quarter will ask students to read books independently. This is where the titles for this project are necessary. \\r\\nMy co-teacher and I have a variety of reading levels in our classroom. In order to accommodate all of their independent reading levels, we need these diverse novel titles. Each of these titles takes place outside the United States. Some are fiction and some are nonfiction to appeal to more interests. The titles also span a variety of reading levels.

They get bored of that pretty quickly, and then they decide not to come anymore.\\r\\nThis equipment will motivate more players to attend off season workouts and help strengthen their soccer skills. The variety of equipment will ensure that they are more interested in coming each week. The more they come, the better the team ends up performing in the end.\\r\\nI am asking for a quick ladder, resistor bands, speed training parachutes, and soccer trainers to help with agility, speed and ball skills.

The paper comes in handy when the students want to show they can write “more letters” - above and beyond what is required – but we have to tell them to practice in a notebook because the paper is reserved for other purposes.    \\r\\nNotebook paper is okay to practice with, but first graders cannot always successfully tear out a page without ripping it – and nobody likes to put a lot of hard work and effort only to accidently destroy it.  \\r\\nAlso, dry eraser markers and dry erase whiteboards are limited in quantity and students are not allowed to take them home.  We also use lots of paper for creating artwork and exercising fine motor skills.  They also need a lot of paper to write numbers and practice their addition and subtraction skills.  The white paper also serves as an opportunity to make a “quick copy” of a newsletter to a parent, a graphic organizer, worksheet, or homework assignment should it be needed.  The amount of white paper requested is for the entire school year!  My white paper project serves as critical tool for learning overall.

This is why we need 21st Century technology tools in the school library so that our students would be ready to show off what they have created and learned in the library. We want our students to be life-long learners who are ready for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive White Board, is an interactive computer system that is displayed through a projector and uses a touch-sensitive board for hands-on interaction. Students can actively participate as Promethean Board offers questions sets, lesson activities, interactive learning objects and many other tools that are designed to help increase student engagement and foster understanding. I/We plan to use this interactive white board in the library. Our district strives for excellence. Incorporating an interactive white board will be an innovate way of ensuring success in helping our students reach their maximum potential.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interactive white board will be used during story time and library skills as supplement to instruction. One of the greatest benefits is that interactive white boards can be used during any unit in any content area. For example, in both story time and library skills, I/we will use its features to guide students through text. I/We can highlight, note take, insert images and video, and be able to better analyze text. The interactive white board will bring my library classes closer to the intangible than ever before. Lessons can be saved or printed for all learners. This is especially important when students are absent. Additionally, I can pause a video and write directly on the screen in order to highlight or circle important concepts. The benefits of the Interactive White Board in my/our library are endless!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the library, students will work with interactive charts, diagrams, websites, and numerous tools that will deepen all students understanding of library skills/reading. Visual learners will be able to view content using innovative lessons. Kinesthetic learners will be able to &#034;touch&#034; and manipulate concepts and learning. Auditory learners will be able to hear information in many ways.

Students that struggle with attention to detail can see the directions on the left screen while they program on the right screen.  \\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced Productivity:\\r\\n&#034;Published studies conclude that by working with dual monitors, overall productivity increases by 20-50%.&#034; *from Techadvisory.org\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents spend a lot of time switching back and forth from tab to tab while reading on one website and then trying to program on another site.  This causes students to lose track and forget what they were asked to do on the &#034;learning site&#034;.  As you can imagine this takes more time and causes more errors when they write the code for their project.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter Multitasking:\\r\\nThis is key to programming games.

It is my responsibility to teach students how to use their devices and screen time productively and engage them in digital tasks that are worthwhile.

Adding STEM components to any lessons is always an attention grabber but when the students are hands on in creating true learning is fueled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past three years it has been my goal to bring coding to the kids at my elementary school.  I began a coding program with my students because of a grant I secured in 2016. Each year, I have been supplementing the program. I started by adding new programs and replacing tech components that have worn out. Since technology is ever changing and always being enhanced and modified that has made it hard to keep the newest gadgets for coding in my students&#039; hands. For this I am asking the help of generous donors to keep our program current and up to date by funding robots like, Cozmo, Botley, Dot, WowWee, and Sphero.  Products like Robot Mouse and Osmo are student favorites and with another component more stations can be in place. Students activate all areas of learning from creativity to collaboration and by applying math concepts and systematic procedural thinking when learning to code.  \\n\\nPairing technology especially coding robots with third grade students will enhance the students core subject areas and allow for them to explore STEM concepts. In this Coding Club classroom program students are given a new technology that is geared to teach them coding. They are challenged to read the directions, troubleshoot their programs, and research the technology they have been given. Once they have, through their own hard work and dedication, learned their device they present and teach their newly acquired coding skills to their younger second grade peers, their families, and other teachers and administrators in the final Coding Fair.

We will also allow students to take their learning further by helping to code on the robot so they can have the opportunity to learn beyond what we teach them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of our robotics team is to inspire underrepresented youth by breaking down barriers to STEM. We believe that many underrepresented students would be able to thrive in a STEM field, but they do not get enough experience to develop a passion.

We are excited to explore the world of computational thinking and computer programming as our school introduces elementary coding classes for all students. I am excited to have the opportunity to work with each of the over 800 students enrolled at our school in this capacity!\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents in our school come from a variety of personal backgrounds, but they share a curiosity about the world around them and a deep desire to make their mark on the world. Our school and division are committed to providing personalized instruction centered on each child’s educational needs while operating from a global perspective. Our curriculum will prepare students to be lifelong learners for the ever-changing global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important skills my students use in coding class is computational thinking. To develop this skill, students need to practice decomposition (breaking down a big problem into smaller, more manageable problems), pattern recognition (noticing numerical, visual, or other similarities within data), abstraction (expressing a pattern in its simplest terms for future use), and algorithm design (deciding on the steps to solve a problem). To many 4th, 5th, and 6th graders, this can feel very abstract. We can help them practice these skills through the use of concrete, hands-on materials like Keva planks.\\r\\nBecause Keva planks are designed to be open-ended and used in a variety of ways, they are perfect for providing opportunities for students to practice computational thinking. Many structures built with these planks look quite different from different viewing angles, and comparing a 3-D structure to 2-dimensional representations of that structure can help students conceptualize decomposition.

The school has a very diverse student population, with the majority of students being Hispanic and African American. More than 90% of the student population lives below the poverty level.   It is extremely hard to get funding for anything. We are a small school that is often overlooked.\\n The students are curious and eager to learn. Sadly, there are not always enough funds for individual classroom projects.\\n\\nI want to use coding skills to teach students computational thinking.\\nComputational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving process that includes some characteristics, such as logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions using a series of ordered steps (or algorithms), and dispositions, such as the ability to confidently deal with complexity and open-ended problems. CT is essential to the development of computer applications, but it can also be used to support problem-solving across all disciplines, including math, science, and the humanities. Students who learn CT across the curriculum can begin to see a relationship between subjects as well as between school and life outside of the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly 80% of future careers will require some STEM skills. A stimulating STEM education is essential for developing the basic analytical, problem-solving and critical thinking skills central to academic achievement and workforce readiness in the 21st century.\\n\\nThis project will address science, technology, engineering and math initiatives.\\nSome of the goals of this project will be to increase students&#039; mathematical skills, to foster skills that enable all students to locate, evaluate, synthesize, apply, and present information effectively, and to promote educational excellence. Students will work in small groups to write computer programs that control how these Dash robots roll. Students will begin with MacroLab - a visual programming app. After completing five MacroLab lessons, students will be ready for advanced lessons in OrbBasic- utilizing a powerful app for text-based programming. These lessons align with the national Common Core Curriculum for 3rd, 4th and 5th grade. Students will complete different lessons to learn the basics of programming the Dash robots, then they will move on to individual challenges that foster team building, problem-solving, and computational thinking. Each lesson has a step-by-step teacher guide, student guide, and worksheet.

Due to the fact that our school does not provide buses we must walk or take public transportation to and from field trip sites. Keeping track of 30 students is a task that requires a lot of diligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure the safety of my students on field trips I want them to all wear the same color designated field trip shirt. The shirts will make the students easily identifiable by me, parent chaperones, and other students. These shirts will also allow me to easily locate them in large crowds and ensure their safety wherever we go. The landyards will include the school name and contact information in the event of an emergency. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese items are all tools to keep my students safe and make my job more efficient.', 'percentFunded': '0', 'numDonors': '0', 'costToComplete': '413.82', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '32', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': '', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': '', 'donorSalutation': '', 'type': '', 'matchImpactMultiple': '', 'multipleForDisplay': '', 'logoURL': '', 'faqURL': '', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': ''}, 'totalPrice': '413.82', 'freeShipping': 'true', 'teacherId': '2237926', 'teacherName': 'Ms. Beverly', 'gradeLevel': {'id': '2', 'name': 'Grades 3-5'}, 'povertyLevel': 'More than three‑quarters of students from low‑income households', 'povertyType': {'label': 'HIGH', 'name': 'More than three‑quarters of students from low‑income households', 'range': '76-89%', 'showPovertyLevel': 'true'}, 'teacherTypes': [], 'schoolTypes': [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Charter'}], 'schoolName': 'Thomas Edison Charter Academy (TECA)', 'schoolUrl': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/school/edison-charter-academy-school/5966/', 'city': 'San Francisco', 'zip': '94114-3405', 'state': 'CA', 'stateFullName': 'California', 'latitude': '37.754852000000000', 'longitude': '-122.426160000000000', 'zone': {'id': '402', 'name': 'California (North)'}, 'subject': {'id': '27', 'name': 'Health &amp; Wellness', 'groupId': '2'}, 'resource': {'id': '18', 'name': 'Food, Clothing &amp; Hygiene'}, 'expirationDate': '2018-12-18', 'fundingStatus': 'needs funding'}, {'id': '3401229', 'proposalURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/project/field-trip-fun/3401229/?utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=bodylink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'fundURL': 'https://secure.donorschoose.org/donors/givingCart.html?proposalid=3401229&donationAmount=45&utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=fundlink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'imageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/small/u4448931_sm.jpg?timestamp=1494124983682', 'retinaImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/retina/u4448931_retina.jpg?timestamp=1494124983682', 'thumbImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/thumbnail/u4448931_thmb.jpg?timestamp=1494124983682', 'title': 'Field Trip Fun!!!', 'shortDescription': 'In my class, we are a team!

Imagine being able to travel to the bottom of the ocean, or ride the worlds biggest roller coaster, and even venture into the Serengeti Plains of Africa.  My students could get a first hand experience without ever leaving the classroom.  \\r\\n     These particular virtual reality headsets need no phone or other piece of technology to work.  This makes it much easier for the students to view the exciting places we study throughout the year.\\r\\n     Some of my students have never left the town of Florence.  Can you imagine how excited they would be for a trip inside a volcano? We need to offer as many things as we can to ensure these students succeed in the world.

The presentations will share with middle school students the information our students gathered about the colleges through the admissions and financial aid information session, campus tour, as well as conversations with EPAPA alumni who are current college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are trying to organize a class trip to see CSU Sonoma State University. We have one alumni from last year who is currently a Sonoma State Freshmen now, and several more from past years. They will be showing us around campus and letting us know about life at their college. We will also meet with the admissions office to learn more about how to prepare our college applications so that we have a good chance at getting into the colleges we apply to this November. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will be bringing back information for the middle school kids to learn more about the colleges that are in the Bay Area, and beyond.

They have not only read  history books, but they have experienced firsthand what they have learned in the classroom, giving them another perspective on history. After our last trip to Dachau, one student returned to class, and while discussing World War II, decided to share his experience with the class, as each student listened intently on what he had to say. \\r\\n\\r\\nI want to take my students to see the world - literally!

However, regardless of the struggles with money, our students have a craving to learn that is amazing.   \\r\\n\\r\\nMany do not have an enriched learning environment at home, so I want to make their learning experience at school as full as possible.  ALL students at our school qualify for free breakfast and lunch and often the parents or caregivers do not have the means to provide reading materials, math manipulatives, homework assistance, and only a small percentage have access to the Internet.  \\r\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research shows that learning happens best when it is done in a way that is practical, relevant, and engaging!  In a perfect world, I would have our students traveling all the time soaking in different environments; however with budget restraints that is not possible.  Many of my students will never have the opportunity to visit The Great Barrier Reef or The Great Wall of China but with this amazing technology, they can experience it and feel like they are actually there.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis project will help 575 students in grades PreK-5th grade enjoy over 400 virtual traveling experiences without ever leaving the walls of the classroom.

We have a large population of students whose families have immigrated to America from Mexico, Guatamala, Sweden, Kenya, China, Haiti, and Iraq.  These students bring other languages and cultural traditions into our small community.  Like the sprinkles in a &#034;funfetti&#034; cake, these children are mixed and blended with our local children, many of whom have never left the county, not even to see the nearby beaches or mountains.  To say we have a wide-range of experiences, needs, abilities, and interests to serve each day is clearly an understatement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, no matter where they come from or where they may be headed, each and every one of our children carries a spark within them we strive to ignite.  This curiosity, if tended, will turn into an eternal flame, a love of learning, of self-growth and improvement, a never-ceasing desire to better themselves and the world around them.  Every one of them is brimming with potential, just waiting to be tapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By incorporating these materials, my students will learn about STEAM principles and how they apply to everyday life.

These will also help my English Language Learners be comfortable while learning new things. Currently, I have a student’s desk raised so that he can dance while class is going on. This small change has eliminated the negative behavior he was doing the first week of school. When students can use movement while learning they engage more.

As a PBIS &#034;Gold&#034; school, we strive to provide a positive school culture among community and students by focusing on behavior and character education. One way we uphold this culture in my class, and classrooms around the school, is by way of incentives. During class time, students are eager to earn school money, &#034;Marley Money&#034;, for their positive behavior and effort. Students can then spend their school money on classroom, grade level, and/or school wide incentives. These incentives heavily involve team building and social opportunities. For example, students can use Marley Money to purchase classroom incentives like shopping the class store or sitting next to a friend for the day. \\nMarley Middle School is a Title I school in which all 900 Marley students receive free breakfast and over 6 of our students receive free and reduced meals during lunch. Despite their challenges, hardships, and struggles, my number one priority is to give students the tools necessary to make good choices and become a better student. These choices will provide themselves and others the best school culture and positive  experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing board game incentives like Checkers, UNO, and Trouble are an excellent way to motivate students to exceed expectations in the classroom.  Too many times, a boring and negative classroom environment will provide no incentive for a reluctant learner to meet the behavioral or academic standard.  Often times I am limited through space and resources of what I can offer my students as an incentive. \\r\\nOffering a variety of games to choose from as a reward, students will not only get excited about coming into the class, but it will also teach proper social interaction and fair play . By working harder during class time to improve behavior and academic outcomes, students will earn themselves a sense of joy and excitement that they may not receive at any other time of day. The joy that accompanies the academic progress will improve their attitudes and effort towards learning.

In addition to their dedication to the tennis team, our players juggle a vast array of activities. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen not playing tennis, our teammates can be found winning math competitions, volunteering at the special needs prom, leading student council, giving back with Beta club, leading national honor society meetings, working on Habitat for Humanity houses, tutoring others, participating in the governor’s honors program, waking up early to enjoy the sunrise, playing guitar, acting in school and church plays, or modeling success. The tennis players wear many hats and are fantastic role models on the tennis court and in the classroom. They hold the title of the highest team GPA of any sport in the school. The team GPA of the tennis program—varsity and junior varsity combined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our tennis team is expanding, but our coaching pool is shrinking! In order to bridge the gap, we are raising funds to purchase a tennis ball machine. This machine will keep more kids involved in tennis with our limited coaching staff. It will allow our beginners to get more reps in practice, so they can eventually crack the varsity line up! We are a public school with an amazing new 10 court tennis facility. \\r\\nThis year we are committed to being a no cut tennis team, so we need new resources to develop our begging tennis player who have limited tennis experience.  Our goal is to increase our teams diversity and encourage more kids to play the great sport of tennis!', 'percentFunded': '37', 'numDonors': '5', 'costToComplete': '1263.26', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '30', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': 'DSG19', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': 'Dick’s Sporting Goods', 'donorSalutation': 'DICK&#039;S Sporting Goods Foundation - Sports Matter', 'type': 'AUTO_DONATION_MATCH', 'matchImpactMultiple': 2, 'multipleForDisplay': '2X', 'logoURL': 'https://cdn.donorschoose.net/images/logos/dicks_250.gif', 'faqURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/donors/matching_grant_popup.html?matchingKey=DSG19', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': '<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.donorschoose.net/images/logos/dicks_250.gif\"></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Donations to this project are now being matched, thanks to support from DICK’S Sporting Goods.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Youth sports are in trouble - billions in funding have been cut from school sports programs in recent years, and 27% of U.S. public high schools could be without sports by 2020.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That\\'s why The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation is matching up to $1.5 million in donations to public school sports teams in communities across the country.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To learn more, please visit our website at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sportsmatter.org\">www.SportsMatter.org</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/donors/search.html?matchingId=1466\">See all projects eligible for this match offer.</a></p>'}, 'totalPrice': '2013.26', 'freeShipping': 'false', 'teacherId': '4978724', 'teacherName': 'Mr. W.', 'gradeLevel': {'id': '4', 'name': 'Grades 9-12'}, 'povertyLevel': 'More than half of students from low‑income households', 'povertyType': {'label': 'MODERATEHIGH', 'name': 'More than half of students from low‑income households', 'range': '51-75%', 'showPovertyLevel': 'true'}, 'teacherTypes': [], 'schoolTypes': [{'id': 11, 'name': 'Bing Our School Needs'}, {'id': 12, 'name': 'Horace Mann (partner)'}, {'id': 15, 'name': 'Kia (partner)'}, {'id': 14, 'name': 'Kia (partner)'}, {'id': 6, 'name': 'Vocational Education'}, {'id': 3, 'name': 'Special Education'}], 'schoolName': 'Glynn Academy', 'schoolUrl': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/school/glynn-academy/49465/', 'city': 'Brunswick', 'zip': '31520-7396', 'state': 'GA', 'stateFullName': 'Georgia', 'latitude': '31.147314000000000', 'longitude': '-81.491473000000000', 'zone': {'id': '313', 'name': 'Georgia'}, 'subject': {'id': '2', 'name': 'Team Sports', 'groupId': '2'}, 'resource': {'id': '14', 'name': 'Sports &amp; Exercise Equipment'}, 'expirationDate': '2018-12-17', 'fundingStatus': 'needs funding'}, {'id': '3662693', 'proposalURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/project/go-west-scrapbooks-to-discover-califor/3662693/?utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=bodylink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'fundURL': 'https://secure.donorschoose.org/donors/givingCart.html?proposalid=3662693&donationAmount=45&utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=fundlink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'imageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/small/u1653064_sm.jpg?timestamp=1378005689126', 'retinaImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/retina/u1653064_retina.jpg?timestamp=1378005689126', 'thumbImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/thumbnail/u1653064_thmb.jpg?timestamp=1378005689126', 'title': 'Go West - Scrapbooks to Discover California History', 'shortDescription': 'I have an amazing group of students who have a strong desire to learn.

Children role play various scenarios they&#039;ve seen the adults in their lives participate in. Every year, during the late fall, Dramatic play is transformed into a grocery store! The grocery store provides students with a chance to work on a variety of early literacy, math, and language skills. Children learn how to sort the various food groups, how to pay for items in a store, the language used in a transaction, as well as the interpersonal skills they need to play cooperatively.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe my students deserve quality made wood products such as a grocery store and lemonade stand, pantry products and play food that will last for many years to come.\\r\\nThe few materials we have for Dramatic play were cheaply made and are in poor condition. Dramatic play has so many benefits to a classroom. Dramatic play encourages children to put themselves in someone else&#039;s shoes. Such role-playing helps them to improve their ability to do this in real life. They learn important social skills, such as empathy. When children re-enact frightening experiences, they tend to put themselves in a position of power. They may choose to play the mommy or daddy, the most powerful people in their lives. In dramatic play, the child can control the events, and wishes can come true. Dramatic play also encourages expressive language. Children are motivated to convey their wishes to others and speak from the perspective of their pretend roles. In fact, it is often through dramatic play that shy or withdrawn children first begin to express themselves through language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;', 'percentFunded': '0', 'numDonors': '0', 'costToComplete': '398.33', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '22', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': '', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': '', 'donorSalutation': '', 'type': '', 'matchImpactMultiple': '', 'multipleForDisplay': '', 'logoURL': '', 'faqURL': '', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': ''}, 'totalPrice': '398.33', 'freeShipping': 'true', 'teacherId': '2657594', 'teacherName': 'Mr. Hughes', 'gradeLevel': {'id': '1', 'name': 'Grades PreK-2'}, 'povertyLevel': 'More than three‑quarters of students from low‑income households', 'povertyType': {'label': 'HIGH', 'name': 'More than three‑quarters of students from low‑income households', 'range': '76-89%', 'showPovertyLevel': 'true'}, 'teacherTypes': [], 'schoolTypes': [{'id': 12, 'name': 'Horace Mann (partner)'}], 'schoolName': 'Orchard Gardens K-8 Pilot School', 'schoolUrl': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/school/orchard-gardens-pilot-school/74279/', 'city': 'Roxbury', 'zip': '02119-2514', 'state': 'MA', 'stateFullName': 'Massachusetts', 'latitude': '42.330525000000000', 'longitude': '-71.077745000000000', 'zone': {'id': '121', 'name': 'Massachusetts'}, 'subject': {'id': '18', 'name': 'Early Development', 'groupId': '5'}, 'additionalSubjects': [{'id': '25', 'name': 'ESL', 'groupId': '6'}], 'resource': {'id': '9', 'name': 'Books'}, 'expirationDate': '2018-10-11', 'fundingStatus': 'needs funding'}, {'id': '3616155', 'proposalURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/project/help-my-band-be-the-cymbal-of-success/3616155/?utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=bodylink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'fundURL': 'https://secure.donorschoose.org/donors/givingCart.html?proposalid=3616155&donationAmount=45&utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=fundlink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'imageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/small/u5686680_sm.jpg?timestamp=1537552638096', 'retinaImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/retina/u5686680_retina.jpg?timestamp=1537552638096', 'thumbImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/thumbnail/u5686680_thmb.jpg?timestamp=1537552638096', 'title': 'Help My Band Be the CYMBAL of Success!', 'shortDescription': \"I'm proud to be working with my new students at in Milwaukee.

If you are familiar with woodwind instruments, such as clarinet, oboe, bassoon or saxophone, you understand that without a reed the instrument will make no sound!  Often students can only afford a single woodwind reed for the entire school year.  By January the reed is chipped, worn out, and possibly growing mold!  Yuck!!!  You can imagine this situation makes their second semester challenging, frustrating and smelly.\\n\\nBy purchasing reeds and reed cases for our woodwind students they will be able to practice good hygiene, rotate multiple reeds to extend longevity, and experiment with different strength reeds to get the best tone from their instrument.   Reed cases and reed cups will help students be prepared and ready to make music for the entire school year!

We make the best possible effort to immerse ourselves in the language and the culture. We even host a semi-annual Chinese New Year festival! My students are engaged in learning the language and, for many, it is the brightest point of their educational experience. Chinese opens doors for students. For example, a senior who recently graduated was even admitted to her dream program at the college of her choice. Her admissions officer informed her that Chinese on the transcript is what sealed the deal. Most of my students have been enrolled in Chinese for years and plan to continue to do so. They talk about studying abroad in college and finding opportunities to work and travel in Asia someday. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research shows without a doubt and almost beyond measure how valuable reading is in learning a new language. We do our best to immerse ourselves in the language and the culture with web-based audio-visual resources and it&#039;s never been easier for Americans to access these kinds of materials. Written materials are  another story, though.  We have located resources, like textbooks and websites, but few are suitable to non-native, beginner-intermediate level learners. Recently, graded readers have started to enter the market. We have tested a few materials and found that students who are reinforcing their language learning with reading are retaining more knowledge and advancing more quickly. Students will use the books to read at their own pace as well as in combination with classroom discussions and group reviews. They will also practice writing by addressing topics from the books. Additionally, I have noticed the students are not only learning Chinese, they are learning more about life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we started reading classics in translation, the students have been more energetic and alive in class. They are more excited to work and to learn. Books are making a huge difference! One of my third-year students remarked, &#034;This is the best learning tool I&#039;ve ever had in Chinese.&#034;  There is a tricky part to all of this reading, though.  Chinese characters are not phonetic and are difficult to look up in dictionaries.  The best solution to this problem is to use a touchscreen to draw a character and instantly pull it up in a dictionary.  Apple tablets are the easiest to use and least glitchy tablets for looking up Chinese characters, that&#039;s why we are trying to get four iPad Minis (to share). Without this technology, it can take several minutes for students to look up a single word.', 'percentFunded': '23', 'numDonors': '1', 'costToComplete': '978.24', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '52', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': '', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': '', 'donorSalutation': '', 'type': '', 'matchImpactMultiple': '', 'multipleForDisplay': '', 'logoURL': '', 'faqURL': '', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': ''}, 'totalPrice': '1272.35', 'freeShipping': 'true', 'teacherId': '3514778', 'teacherName': 'Mr. Stout', 'gradeLevel': {'id': '4', 'name': 'Grades 9-12'}, 'povertyLevel': 'More than half of students from low‑income households', 'povertyType': {'label': 'MODERATEHIGH', 'name': 'More than half of students from low‑income households', 'range': '51-75%', 'showPovertyLevel': 'true'}, 'teacherTypes': [], 'schoolTypes': [{'id': 12, 'name': 'Horace Mann (partner)'}, {'id': 13, 'name': 'CenturyLink'}, {'id': 6, 'name': 'Vocational Education'}, {'id': 3, 'name': 'Special Education'}], 'schoolName': 'Prairie Du Chien High School', 'schoolUrl': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/school/prairie-du-chien-high-school/37095/', 'city': 'Pr Du Chien', 'zip': '53821-2399', 'state': 'WI', 'stateFullName': 'Wisconsin', 'latitude': '43.042204000000000', 'longitude': '-91.139604000000000', 'zone': {'id': '204', 'name': 'Wisconsin'}, 'subject': {'id': '22', 'name': 'Foreign Languages', 'groupId': '6'}, 'additionalSubjects': [{'id': '3', 'name': 'Literature &amp; Writing', 'groupId': '6'}], 'resource': {'id': '7', 'name': 'Computers &amp; Tablets'}, 'expirationDate': '2018-12-23', 'fundingStatus': 'needs funding'}, {'id': '3525922', 'proposalURL': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/project/a-classroom-to-enjoy/3525922/?utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=bodylink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'fundURL': 'https://secure.donorschoose.org/donors/givingCart.html?proposalid=3525922&donationAmount=45&utm_source=api&utm_medium=feed&utm_content=fundlink&utm_campaign=DONORSCHOOSE', 'imageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/small/u1825336_sm.jpg?timestamp=1448993544597', 'retinaImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/retina/u1825336_retina.jpg?timestamp=1448993544597', 'thumbImageURL': 'https://storage.donorschoose.net/dc_prod/images/user/thumbnail/u1825336_thmb.jpg?timestamp=1448993544597', 'title': 'A Classroom to Enjoy!', 'shortDescription': \"My students face some of the hardest challenges at my school.

Our school has had a rich history as an arts and technology magnet school as well as a dual language immersion school, however in the last decade has struggled with the achievement gap for socioeconomically disadvantaged students and students of color. Hispanic and African-American students represent the largest proportions of the school population and have struggled in test scores particularly in math and science. Just over 50% of our school is certified low income, and students that fall into this category have also achieved lower-than-expected results especially in STEM. \\r\\nThese students are some of the most clever, curious, and considerate young people I’ve ever had the pleasure of teaching. From little things like holding the door open to larger student-led community works projects like community composting, the students at this school work hard every day not just to learn, but to improve their school and neighborhood. Seeing their energy, empathy, and enthusiasm, I know each and every one of them has the potential to succeed, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math. \\r\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I try to inspire and empower my students every day by providing them with hands-on investigations, observations, and experiments, but I need your help.  Hands-on learning is paramount in science education, but it’s just not possible for students to directly experience evolution or the geologic timescale. In seventh grade science students are learning about earth history, a subject which requires them to observe and question landforms and the forces that shaped them, but to truly understand, students really have to see it. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this school most students have never left their city, let alone have the opportunity to visit natural wonders around the world; the only way that they can experience the awe and impact of something like the Grand Canyon or Mount Saint Helens is through digital media. Though a decade-old LCD projector was provided by the district, the resolution is so poor that the students rarely grasp what they are looking at. Despite this, my students are always excited to explore the world digitally, and ask for more videos and photographs of what we are learning. With a high definition projector in the classroom, students will finally be able to see and understand the awesome scale of nature and have a context for understanding the forces that shaped our earth. We will be able to tour the world in Google Earth, watch breathtaking videos of volcanic eruptions, or connect to a digital microscope and look at live microorganisms in real time. With Geosafari rocks, and a relief map in the classroom as well, they will be able to reach out and touch what they are seeing projected. Finally, HP 02 printer ink will allow me to refill the only color printer on our school&#039;s campus and print out learning aids and student work in full vibrant color.', 'percentFunded': '0', 'numDonors': '0', 'costToComplete': '1285.61', 'studentLed': False, 'numStudents': '129', 'professionalDevelopment': False, 'matchingFund': {'matchingKey': '', 'ownerRegion': '', 'name': '', 'donorSalutation': '', 'type': '', 'matchImpactMultiple': '', 'multipleForDisplay': '', 'logoURL': '', 'faqURL': '', 'amount': '0.00', 'description': ''}, 'totalPrice': '1285.61', 'freeShipping': 'false', 'teacherId': '5933377', 'teacherName': 'Mr. Bairzin', 'gradeLevel': {'id': '3', 'name': 'Grades 6-8'}, 'povertyLevel': 'More than half of students from low‑income households', 'povertyType': {'label': 'MODERATEHIGH', 'name': 'More than half of students from low‑income households', 'range': '51-75%', 'showPovertyLevel': 'true'}, 'teacherTypes': [], 'schoolTypes': [{'id': 3, 'name': 'Special Education'}], 'schoolName': 'Longfellow Middle School', 'schoolUrl': 'https://www.donorschoose.org/school/longfellow-middle-school/24013/', 'city': 'Berkeley', 'zip': '94703-1899', 'state': 'CA', 'stateFullName': 'California', 'latitude': '37.858414000000000', 'longitude': '-122.278946000000000', 'zone': {'id': '402', 'name': 'California (North)'}, 'subject': {'id': '6', 'name': 'Applied Sciences', 'groupId': '4'}, 'additionalSubjects': [{'id': '7', 'name': 'Environmental Science', 'groupId': '4'}], 'resource': {'id': '8', 'name': 'Instructional Technology'}, 'expirationDate': '2019-01-30', 'fundingStatus': 'needs funding'}]}\n",
